### Working with components in autonolas-frontend-library

When developing changes in the `autonolas-frontend-library` repo that you wish to see in any other repository, let's take for example `your-library`, follow the yarn linking process to resolve this dependency locally rather than downloading the published library package.

1. In `autonolas-frontend-library`, run `yarn link`. This creates a symlink on your machine pointing to the library. You may require sudo permissions to run this command.
2. In `your-library`, run `yarn link "@autonolas/frontend-library`. This tells yarn to get the library from your symlink instead of downloading the package from GitHub.

Once the package is linked, run `yarn run build:watch` in the `autonolas-frontend-library` repo, make changes, and see them hot reloaded into `your-library`.

Once you are done developing in `autonolas-frontend-library`, you can follow the steps below to unlink the local package. Otherwise, you may see issues if your `autonolas-frontend-library` repo is not up to date.

1. In `your-library`, run `yarn unlink --no-save autonolas-frontend-library`. The `--no-save` flag is important to ensure that the dependency is not removed from `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.
2. In `your-library`, run `yarn install autonolas-frontend-library` to fetch the latest published version from GitHub.
3. In `autonolas-frontend-library`, run `yarn unlink` to delete the symlink created by yarn. You may require sudo permissions to run this command.
